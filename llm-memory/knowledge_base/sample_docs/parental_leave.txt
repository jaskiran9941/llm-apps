TechCorp Parental Leave Policy

1. Overview
TechCorp supports employees during major life events. Our parental leave policy provides paid time off for the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child.

2. Eligibility
Parental leave is available to all full-time employees who have completed at least 6 months of employment before the expected date of birth or placement.

3. Leave Duration
Birth Parent (Primary Caregiver):
- 16 weeks of fully paid leave
- Can be taken continuously or intermittently within 12 months of birth/placement

Non-Birth Parent (Secondary Caregiver):
- 8 weeks of fully paid leave
- Can be taken continuously or intermittently within 12 months of birth/placement

Adoptive and Foster Parents:
- Both parents eligible for 16 weeks each
- Applies to children under 18 years old

4. Requesting Leave
Employees should notify their manager and HR at least 30 days before the expected leave start date. For unexpected situations (early birth, emergency placement), notify as soon as possible.

Required documentation:
- Birth certificate (for birth parents)
- Adoption or foster placement paperwork
- Healthcare provider documentation if applicable

5. During Leave
- Benefits (health insurance, 401k) continue during paid leave
- Vacation and sick time continue to accrue
- You are not expected to work or respond to emails
- Stay in touch with HR for return-to-work planning

6. Return to Work
Employees returning from parental leave:
- Are guaranteed the same or equivalent position
- Can request flexible scheduling for the first 4 weeks back
- May participate in gradual return program (reduced hours for 2 weeks)

7. Additional Considerations
Combination with Other Leave:
- Parental leave can be combined with accrued vacation if desired
- Short-term disability may apply for medical complications (separate coverage)

Multiple Births/Placements:
- Leave duration is the same regardless of number of children (twins, triplets, etc.)

Extended Unpaid Leave:
- Employees may request additional unpaid leave under FMLA
- Up to 12 weeks additional (must meet FMLA eligibility)

8. State-Specific Benefits
Some states provide additional parental leave benefits. TechCorp leave runs concurrently with state programs. Contact HR for state-specific information.

9. Partner Benefits
Partners and spouses of TechCorp employees may be eligible for benefits continuation during parental leave. See Benefits team for details.
