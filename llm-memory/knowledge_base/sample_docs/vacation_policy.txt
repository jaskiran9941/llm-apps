TechCorp Vacation and Time Off Policy

1. Annual Vacation Days
All full-time employees are entitled to 15 vacation days per year. Part-time employees receive vacation time prorated based on their hours worked.

2. Accrual and Availability
Vacation days begin accruing on your first day of employment. Days are accrued at a rate of 1.25 days per month. New employees can use accrued vacation after completing 90 days of employment.

3. Carryover Rules
Employees may carry over up to 5 unused vacation days to the following year. Any days beyond 5 will be forfeited. Carryover days must be used within the first 6 months of the new year.

4. Requesting Time Off
Vacation requests should be submitted at least 2 weeks in advance through the HR portal. Requests are subject to manager approval and business needs. During peak business periods (Q4), vacation may be restricted.

5. Holidays
In addition to vacation days, TechCorp observes 10 federal holidays:
- New Year's Day
- Martin Luther King Jr. Day
- Presidents Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving (2 days)

6. Sick Leave
Sick leave is separate from vacation time. Employees receive 10 sick days per year. Sick days do not roll over and are not paid out upon termination.

7. Unpaid Leave
Employees may request unpaid leave for personal reasons. Approval is at management discretion and depends on business needs and the employee's tenure.
